# READ THIS README BEFORE OPENING FILES

You will be working with a partner to practice technical interviews. One person will present (be the interviewer) for Sponge. One person will present (be the interviewer) for Pig.

## Step 1 - In-class

**Decide with your partner who will present which question now** I'm doing Sponge. partner doing Big

Follow the directions on canvas for the pair interview signup5. 

## Step 2 - Individually

In "Pig/Sponge Interview Signup" you submitted which question your partner will be asking you. For this individual assignment, you will be doing THE OTHER PROBLEM. For example, if your interviewer is asking you "Sponge", you should do "Pig" for this assignment. DO NOT LOOK AT THE PROBLEM YOUR PARTNER WILL ASK YOU.

Set aside 30 minutes where you can work without stopping and with no distractions. Start a timer for 30 minutes, and open the problem you are to work on, (for example, Pig.java).

Work on the problem for at least 30 minutes with NO OUTSIDE RESOURCES (no notes, googling, etc). If you are not finished after 30 minutes, that's OK! If you are still making progress, continue to solve the problem. If after 30 minutes you are stuck, you can look at the solution (e.g. PigSolution.java) for help. Go back and finish your solution after, don't just copy/paste from the solution. Add/commit/push your solution.

Regardless of whether you completed it within the time or not, still look at the solution and read the interviewer guide. It has hints on how you can help your partner if they get stuck.

To submit this assignment copy your finished code on Canvas. Do not yet make a PR.

## Step 3 - Pair

With your interviewer, do a live interview for the problem you have not yet solved. Your interviewer should have already solved this problem. You should both have already cloned the repository.

The interviewer should have the solution on their computer so they can answer questions the candidate has and give hints. They should be able to see the candidate's progress via liveshare or Zoom.

The interviewer should read the question out loud to the candidate. Once the interviewer is done reading, start the timer. Spend 30 minutes on the interview, staying in character for the whole time.

During the interview, the following is allowed:

- Running the code
- Adding print statements
- Asking the interviewer questions
- Using web searches to search for Java syntax (e.g "how to convert a character to uppercase Java")

Once you are finished, have a short discussion with your interviewer about how it went. Please be kind and gentle to each other and yourself!

On your own time, please finish the problem. It is OK to look at the sample solution. Add/commit/push your code and make a PR against the original repository. There are reflection questions on Canvas. Please answer them individually.
